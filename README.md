# Macro Keyboard GUI

## Behaviour
  The GUI should display 9 buttons in the center which represents the buttons from the keyboard.
  If one of the buttons gets clicked there will be a label underneath which displays the saved shortcut.
  Below that there will be an entry were the user can input the desired shortcut.
  On the other side of the window ther will be two extra buttons.
  On of them will save the newly inputed shortcut.
  The other one will connect the GUI to the Marco-Keyboard.
  The inputed shortcuts will also gets saved in an external file because there is no dedicated memory for that.
  Besides that the GUI also has to deal with the USB-Connectivity.
